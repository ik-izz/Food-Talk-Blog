# Food-Talk-Blog

Worked in a team of 16 to build a food blog using Django and Python as the backend and HTML, CSS, JS as the frontend.

The website has a simple yet modern design. The viewer is greeted with an animated greeting to enhance the browsing experience and give a quick overview of what the site has to offer.

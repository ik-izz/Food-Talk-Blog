# Food-Talk-Blog

Worked in a team of 16 to build a food blog website with an interactive UI using Django and Python as the backend and HTML, CSS, JS as the frontend.

The website has a simple yet modern design. The viewer is greeted with an animated greeting to enhance the browsing experience and give a quick overview of what the site has to offer.

The landing page is designed with the user in mind. The user has the option to browse all the recipes on the landing page and hover over the images to get a quick description. The user has the option to select one of the four categories to narrow down their options to the type of recipes they desire.

Myself, my teammates Thin and Shiming worked on the front end for the breakfast section. We created a seamless design that is aesthetically pleasing. The user has access to the recipe as well as a link to a youtube video should they need further assistance. The user has the option to like the recipe and leave a comment should they desire.

I worked on the backend as well. I linked all my teammates files by creating the proper paths, fixing formatting issues and of course debugging.

I created the functions to render the proper files when requested:

I created the paths which specifies how the path shows up in the users web browser and made sure it calls the proper function to render the correct page.

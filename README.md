# Food-Talk-Blog

Worked in a team of 16 to build a food blog using Django and Python as the backend and HTML, CSS, JS as the frontend.

The website has a simple yet modern design. The viewer is greeted with an animated greeting to enhance the browsing experience and give a quick overview of what the site has to offer.

The landing page is designed with the user in mind. The user has the option to browse all the recipes on ther landing page, hover over the images to get a quick description, or the user has the option to select one of the four catagories to narrow down their options to the type of recipes they desire.
